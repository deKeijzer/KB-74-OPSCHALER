<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/appendix/datacamp/General.png"> </p>

One of my personal goals was to finish the [Data Scientist with Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) track on DataCamp ([statement of accomplishment](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/a5c7f47662f67b9a19bf1a214c3316ecb7573b62)). Apart from this I also did some other courses which seemed usefull for project Opschaler. All mandatory courses for the minor have been finished. Screenshots of the completed courses are shown below. Links to the course description including the statement of accomplishment can be seen below the screenshots.

### Fast.ai
`TODO: Start doing Kaggle competitions as proof of having followed these courses?`  
The courses from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) got recommended by a teacher as extra / more advanced material. They offer a Python package that allows the usage of more state of the art deep learnings methods, in a more simple and less code intensive way than is currently (21-11-2018) possible with Keras and TensorFlow. Their course material consists of lectures and example notebooks of the covered material during those lectures. The following courses have been followed.  

* Deep learning part 1
  * Recognizing cats and dogs (image recognition): [link to course](https://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson1.html)
  * Convolutional neural networks: [link to course](https://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson2.html)

## Python notebooks
`TODO: Only list relevant notebooks that show what has been learned. For example: do not list 5 notebooks for reading in data.`  
`TODO: Add screenshots of important code & plots to show the learning progress`  
`TODO: Clean up and run all notebooks show the correct output is shown.`  
`TODO: Dump final versions of notebooks to pdf and link to those.`  
All notebooks have been commented, apart from lines where the programming is basic Python (for data science). Besides commenting code, i try to document all changes by committing small changes to GitHub. Doing this helped to document the work being done. However, the amount of commits obviously is no estimate of the quality of the work.  

<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/appendix/github_commits_v2.png"> </p>
  
Quite a lot of notebooks which are relevant for Opschaler have been created. Most started out as smaller notebooks, to learn the programming techniques required for the job. Later on a lot of the smaller notebooks have been combined in larger important notebooks. Important notebooks have been marked with a (!), really important ones are marked with a (!!). These are notebooks that contain main code for Opschaler.  
  
The notebooks that have been made for Opschaler are:
  
* Data preperation  
This is the process of preparing the raw data for analysis, getting the data in easy useable DataFrames. The raw data consists of sensor data per dwelling, smartmeter data per dwelling and KNMI weather data of a station in Rotterdam. The smartmeter dataframes consists of merged electricity and gasmeter frames. Certain datafiles are in nested folders, with each file having a uniqiue name. The file types are both `.csv` and `.xlsx`. 
  * Reading in data 
    * Reading in raw sensor + excel data: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/Data_preperation/Reading%20_in_data/reading_in_raw_sensor%2Bexcel_data.ipynb)

* KNMI  
In these notebooks the 10 minute resolution weather data is processed. This data has been received by mail from the KNMI. The raw data consists of a folder with multiple `.csv` files. There are different file types depending on the measured variables and the year in which the values were measured.  
  * (!) Combining DataFrames: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/KNMI/1.KNMI_high_resolution_combining_dfs.ipynb)

  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/KNMI/KNMI%20visualization.ipynb)

* (!) EDA  
Notebooks that contain general EDA on the created DataFrames which contain all the combined raw data per dwelling. Plus a table containing usefull information per dwelling has been created. 
  * EDA on dwelling P01S01W8655: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/EDA/EDA%20on%20dwelling%20P01S01W8655.ipynb)
  * Raw dwelling information table: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/EDA/Raw%20dwelling%20information%20table.ipynb)
  * Reading in all dwellings, plus making correlation matrices: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/EDA/reading%20in%20%26%20correlation%20matrices%20on%20processed%20data.ipynb)
  
* PyCharm  
The 'data_preperation_main.py' file used to be the main script to create the prepared dwelling data. Later on Dask has been implemented due to having improved performance because of being able to parallelize tasks on multiple CPU cores.  
  * (!) Data preperation main script: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/EDA/reading%20in%20%26%20correlation%20matrices%20on%20processed%20data.ipynb)

* Dask  
Currently (29-10-2018) this is the main notebook for all the data processing done for the Opschaler project. This notebook has implemented most relevant functions from previously listed notebooks in a way so they can be run in parallel with Dask. It basically takes all raw data and saves unprocessed and processed (NaNs taken care off) `.csv` files per dwelling, which can be used for analysis.
  * (!!) Dask data processing: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/Dask/Dask%20data%20processing.ipynb)

* Keras  
This folder contains all the notebooks related to deep learning. Note that there are multiple notebooks being very similar to each other. Sometimes the only difference inbetween similar notebooks are changes in settings (nodes, layers and selected dwellings). Most notebooks start off with EDA to check if the correct data is being used, then the model is being created and evaluated.
  * Feedforward
    * All dwellings EDA + machine learning: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/Keras/feedforward/all%20dwellings%20EDA%20%2B%20machine%20learning.ipynb)  
  Notebooks containing feedforward models.  
    * 8655 gasPower, sample rate 1 day: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/Keras/feedforward/8655%20gasPower%201D.ipynb)

  Notebook used to learn how LSTM time series prediction works.
    * (!) 8655 RNN LSTM: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/Keras/LSTM/8655%20RNN%20LSTM.ipynb)
  * sequence to sequence  
  Notebook used to learn how sequence to sequence time series prediction works.

   * Opschaler LSTM & seq2seq main  
   These notebooks contain the currently (29-10-2018) being used deep learning models. There also is a notebook where the input data shape of LSTM has been analyzed. This has made because it was quite unclear how this actually was done, dispite reading a lot of literature about it.  
     * (!) LSTM data preperation: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Brian/Keras/LSTM%20data%20preperation.ipynb)

       * Results  
       Pictures of current results. For 'single layer LSTM' a single LSTM input layer of size 35 has been used. The input data is of an hourly sample rate. The previous 5*24 samples have been used as timesteps (also known as look back). The mean of gasPower from all dwelling from `all_dwellings_combined_hour.csv` per datetime value has been taken. Avarage error is the average percentage difference between the predicted and true value. The original images can be downloaded to get view them in high resolution.

          * Sequence 2 sequence with a daile sample rate: still need to create this
   

**Note about shared work:** `PyCharm: Data preperation main script` and `Dask: Dask data processing` contain functions which were made by other group members. Some of these functions (NaN figure for example) have been adapted and changed by me. Besides that, all listed notebooks are made by me.

## Scrum
`TODO: Don't link individual tickets, possibly show a screenshot of each task board.`  
`TODO: Combine these tickets with the notebooks. `  
`TODO: Say that after week 10 we stopped using Scrum due to it not being particulary usefull (in the way it should be used) for our research.`  
The guidelines set up by the minor make it mandatory to use Scrum. We are doing small sprints with a length of 2 weeks. Personally I like to do the most throughout documentation in GitHub with for example commits. However, I did use Scrum to document my time spend on tasks related to the minor.  
* [Sprint 1](https://www.scrumwise.com/scrum/#/taskboard/sprint/sprint-1/id-84641-11359-18)  
It seems that a lot of Scrum tickets are missing.
  * (3h) Datacamp course 1+2
  * (2h) Visualizing practise data: create practise data for the group, to create visualizations from.
* [Sprint 2](https://www.scrumwise.com/scrum/#/taskboard/sprint/sprint-2/id-84641-11359-120)  
It seems that a lot of Scrum tickets are missing.
  * (14h) Cleaning data
* [Sprint 3](https://www.scrumwise.com/scrum/#/taskboard/sprint/sprint-3/id-84641-11359-158)
  * (7.5h) NaN information per dwelling, one large table
  * (33h) Datacamp KB-74 assignments
  * (4h) NaN streak checker function
  * (5h) NaN checker plot function
  * (4h) EDA on dwelling P01S01W8655
  * (3h) Correlation heatmaps of all dwellings
  * (2h) EDA + multi variate regression on all dwellings
  * (8h) Prepare dwelling dataframes (unprocessed)
  * (1h) Combine dataframes (smartmeter, weather)
  * (20h) Prepare dwelling dataframes (processed)
  * (5h) Prepare high resolution weather df
  * (2h) GitHub README: document important notebooks & datalocations
  * (1.5h) Create two files which contain all the 'combined_gas_smart_weather_dfs'
  * (2h) Correctly document my own Scrumwise tasks
  * (8h) Preprocessing data for deep learning
* [Sprint 4](https://www.scrumwise.com/scrum/#/taskboard/sprint/sprint-4/id-84641-11393-72)  
A lot of time has gone into certain tasks due to searching for literature, reading literature and learning how certain things should be done.
  * (7.5h) NaN information per dwelling, in one large table
  * (8h) Preprocessing data for deep learning
  * (35h) Basic LSTM & seq2seq
  * (35h) Feedforward NNs
  * (8h) Hyperparameter optimazation
  * (18h) Preprocessing for LSTM

## Other
Other contributions to the project / learning progress, worth mentioning.

### GitHub
Introduced the group to GitHub and made some resources that help with the setup and usage of GitHub at the datascience server. It can be clearly seen when project Opschaler has been started, as pointed out by the red arrow below.

* Setup a GitHub environment for the project, plus keep maintaining it: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER)  
* Made a README for the project members containing information on how to setup GitHub on the datascience server, plus general important information about the project: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/README.md)  
* Made a GitHub push & pull tutorial: [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/GitHub%20push%20%26%20pull%20tutorial.ipynb)  
* Created .bat files to run [jupyter lab](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/jupyterlab.bat), [run notebooks](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/run_notebook.bat) and do [ssh portforwarding](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/ssh%20portforward.bat) for usage at your local computer.
