  <b>This is my portfolio for the minor Applied data science from the Hague University of applied sciences. I am a third year student industrial engineering and management. Befor I started this minor I had no background in programming Python, but I was keen on learning the skill. I was assigned with other fellow students to project OPSCHALER from the TU Delft. The project OPSCHALER started in September 2018 till January 2019. The goal for project OPSCHALER was to analyze smart meter data from 54 dwellings to see if it was possible to accurately predict residential energy consumption. One of the key points was to see if it was possible to predict energy consumption with as few paramaters as possible with the use of the residential housing and KNMI data. This portfolio will mainly focussed on what I learned during the minor. I hope you do enjoy my portfolio.</b><br>

### Completed Courses

#### Datacamp
  I have completed the mandatory Datacamp courses. Which I found very helpfull for beginning programmers. Below you can see my score and completed chapters:

#### Coursera
  I have also completed the mandatory Coursera machine learning courses by Stanford university from Andrew Ng. Even though

### Data preperation and cleaning
  Data preperation and cleaning are known in data science as very time consuming tasks. Since I didn't have any experience with Python I searched the internet for usefull guides on how to prep and clean the data we had. At first we only had smart meter data from 60 dwellings which now have been reduced to 52 dwellings. There were quite a lot of problems with the data sets from smart meter data and KNMI data. Before I even attempted in cleaning & prepping the "real" smartmeter data I searched for a random dataset and started prepping and cleaning to practice and develop my skills. See the link to my basic data prep&clean code on a IMDB movie rating.

#### Communication

As In have mentioned in the beginnen of my portfolio. Before I started this minor I didn't have any programming background. I have done a lot of research in the first couple of weeks on different topics regarding data science. I made a couple of documents containing helpfull information about: Fourier, Linear Regression, Regressional types, Neural networks, Seaborn, guide on how to use Pandas. I created these documents for me to better understand Python and machine learnng and so my groupmates could also benefit from the documents. I have also created a Flow-chart based on the main code from OPSCHALER which has been changed over time. It was quite important for the progress of the group to have an overview of what we we're exactly doing at the time.
