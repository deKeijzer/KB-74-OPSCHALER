This portfolio describes the work I (Daan Boesten) have done during the minor Applied Data Science. This minor was held in the period from September 2018 to January 2019 at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. With a group of 6 students we were assigned to the project OPSCHALER, in which we try to predict the energy consumption of residential houses using several machine learning methods.

The OPSCHALER group consists of members from the TU Delft, The Hague University and several companies which can be found here http://www.opschaler.nl/partners/. Thus far the TU Delft has recorded energy consumption data from 60 different residential houses which have been used to reach the goal of this minor. 

During this minor we tried to answer the following research question:

Is  it possible to accurately predict the house energy consumption with few physical building parameters and the climate data with use of multivariate regression models and neural network models?

After consulation with the OPSCHALER group it was decided to predict the energy consumption for a week ahead with hourly, daily and weekly resolutions. Three different methods were chosen to predict the energy consumption and compare them based on the accuracy:

1. Multivariate regression
2. Fourier series
3. Neural networks 

| Resolution | Multivariate regression | Fourier series | Neural networks |
|------|------|------|------|
| Hourly | 60% | ..% | ..% |  
| Daily  | 30% | ..% | ..% |
| Weekly | 10% | ..% | ..% |

The contents of your personal portfolio should reflect your contribution to the project, your abilities and what you have learned. Your portfolio should consist of materials that you either realized individually, or in case of a group effort, a clear statement of what your contribution is in this group effort.

It is important to write your (digital) portfolio in a very easily accessible way. The main document should be like a reader's guide that shortly introduces your contributions and links to pages where the contributions are described in detail. Every contribution should be accessible from the reader's guide in a single click. We are not going to browse the folder, so if you do not link to a document from the reader's guide, we will not include it in the assessment.

Additional portfolio requirements:

Include your Friday presentations
Add screenshots of the online courses you have finished (DataCamp, Coursera, etc)
Link to the Python Notebooks you have finished (you can dump them to PDF)
List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.
Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities
