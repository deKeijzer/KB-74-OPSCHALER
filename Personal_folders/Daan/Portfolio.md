__Introduction__

This portfolio describes the work I (Daan Boesten) have done during the minor Applied Data Science. This minor was held in the period from September 2018 to January 2019 at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. With a group of 6 students we were assigned to the project OPSCHALER, in which we tried to predict the energy consumption of residential houses using several machine learning methods.

The OPSCHALER group consists of members from the TU Delft, The Hague University and several companies which can be found here http://www.opschaler.nl/partners/. Thus far the TU Delft has recorded energy consumption data from 60 different residential houses which have been used to reach the goal of this minor. 

During this minor we tried to answer the following research question:

_Is  it possible to accurately predict the house energy consumption with few physical building parameters and the climate data with use of multivariate regression models and neural network models?_

After consulation with the OPSCHALER group it was decided to predict the energy consumption for a week ahead with hourly, daily and weekly resolutions. Three different methods were compared based on the accuracy of the prediction:

1. Multivariate regression
2. Fourier series
3. Neural networks 

| Resolution | Multivariate regression | Fourier series | Neural networks |
|------|------|------|------|
| Hourly | ..% | ..% | ..% |  
| Daily  | ..% | ..% | ..% |
| Weekly | ..% | ..% | ..% |

It was also important to compare the amount of computing power needed for the prediction. The ultimate goal of OPSCHALER is to locally predict the energy consumption using smartmeter data, with a preference for low computing power methods to minimize costs and power consumption. 
    
__Personal Work__
  
My interest in data science began when I first learned about the usage of artificial neural networks for pattern recognition. It was incredible to see neural networks being used for many different applications such as autonomous driving, human speech recognition and even the recognition of brain tumors. I really wanted learn this in depth, so the minor Applied Data Science would be a good introduction to the use of machine learning for big data.
