The contents of your personal portfolio should reflect your contribution to the project, your abilities and what you have learned. Your portfolio should consist of materials that you either realized individually, or in case of a group effort, a clear statement of what your contribution is in this group effort.

It is important to write your (digital) portfolio in a very easily accessible way. The main document should be like a reader's guide that shortly introduces your contributions and links to pages where the contributions are described in detail. Every contribution should be accessible from the reader's guide in a single click. We are not going to browse the folder, so if you do not link to a document from the reader's guide, we will not include it in the assessment.

Additional portfolio requirements:

Include your Friday presentations
Add screenshots of the online courses you have finished (DataCamp, Coursera, etc)
Link to the Python Notebooks you have finished (you can dump them to PDF)
List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.
Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities
