MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION 

Advantages:

-Really easy to implement
-Fast to implement
-Not computionally expensivee
-Help us to take a first view of which features might help in other models


Disadvantages:

-Regression dont understand of human patterns (or even patterns?) Possible solution: creating dummie variables? 
-Really difficult to reach a good prediction
-The use of too many features for getting to a good result may end in overfitting 
-Depends too much in your data (quality, quantity, if its easy to predict or have too many anomalies...)



DEEP NEURAL NETWORK

Advantages:

-Most simple model of NN
-Dont need of a high level of coding
-Can lead to good results 
-Easy to tune

Disadvantages:

-You cannot control what happens inside the DNN
-Most simple model of NN
-Need good data
-Computionally expensive
