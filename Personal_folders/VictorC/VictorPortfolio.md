# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

This personal portofolio performs the analysis of the contribution of Víctor Gómez Muñoz, exchange student studying *Applied Data Science* in *The Hague University of Applied Science*, to the project *Opschaler*. 

## DATACAMP COURSES

When I applied to this minor my first priority was learning python. I have worked before with other programing languages such as *Matlab*, *C#* , *R*... Here is a small summary of my progress in *Datacamp*:

## Coursera: Machine Learning by Stanford University

I finished the compulsory *Coursera* weeks 1,2,3 and 6, with their respectives tests (None of the programing tasks were completed):

## Friday Presentations

In the list below you find all the presentations of *Opshaler* group I took part in. For each of the presentations we chose two different persons so that everyone is involved.

<p>[Week 1](https://prezi.com/p/28wycwuqqggc/#present), presented by Megan & Brian, made by all group members.</p>
<p>[Week 2](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/7-9-2018.pptx).</p>   
<p>[Week 8](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/17-10-2018%20good.pptx).</p>
<p>[Week 13](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/23-11-2018%20(2).pptx).</p> 

## Paper Contibution

The [research paper]() was the main goal of this project. The parts I have written are :

<p>-*DNN methodology part* (suffered changes made by brian and group suggestions. Also figures are not done by me).</p>
<p>-*Conclusions* (Made with my teamate Daan, and also changed with group suggestions and Baldiri feedback).</p>
<p>-*Results from MVLR,DNN, and GRU* (First time we wrote this part, it was done by Megan. However, results changed a lot because a validation problem we had,so I rewrote everything again.)</p>

## Python Notebooks

This image show the commitments I did during the project:

The notebooks I have work on are the ones listed below:

-This notebook was done at the beginning of the project with the help of brian. It was the first time we were cleaning and processing data.[-Load_Files.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/Load_Files.ipynb)

-This notebook reproduce multivariate linear regression for the forecasting of gas usage.[-REGRESSION.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/REGRESSION/REGRESSION.ipynb)

-This notebook reproduce a Deep neural network for the forecasting of gas usage.[-DNN.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/NEURAL/DNN.ipynb)

-This notebook was the first time I tried MVLR. Its not finsihed, but I used different librarys to the other notebooks.
