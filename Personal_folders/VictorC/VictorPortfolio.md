# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

This personal portofolio performs the analysis of the contribution of Víctor Gómez Muñoz, exchange student studying *Applied Data Science* in *The Hague University of Applied Science*, to the project *Opschaler*. 

## DATACAMP COURSES

When I applied to this minor my first priority was learning python. I have worked before with other programing languages such as *Matlab*, *C#* , *R*... Here is a small summary of my progress in *Datacamp*:

## Coursera: Machine Learning by Stanford University

I finished the compulsory *Coursera* weeks 1,2,3 and 6, with their respectives tests (None of the programing tasks were completed):

## Friday Presentations

In the list below you find all the presentations of *Opshaler* group I took part in. For each of the presentations we chose two different persons so that everyone is involved.

<p>[Week 1](https://prezi.com/p/28wycwuqqggc/#present), presented by Megan & Brian, made by all group members.</p>
<p>[Week 2](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/7-9-2018.pptx).</p>   
<p>[Week 8](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/17-10-2018%20good.pptx).</p>
<p>[Week 13](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/23-11-2018%20(2).pptx).</p> 

## Paper Contibution

The [research paper](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/Opschaler%20paper%20-%2011-01-2019.pdf) was the main goal of this project. The parts I have written are :

<p>-<b>DNN methodology part</b>(suffered changes made by brian and group suggestions. Also figures are not done by me).</p>
<p>-<b>Conclusions</b> (Made with my teamate Daan, and also changed with group suggestions and Baldiri feedback).</p>
<p>-<b>Results from MVLR,DNN, and GRU</b> (First time we wrote this part, it was done by Megan. However, results changed a lot because a validation problem we had,so I rewrote everything again. At the end Pol moved it to the conclusion, and suffered more changes)</p>


Furthermore, we created an excel with references, were we all added the ones that could be usefull or related to our project.

## Python Notebooks

This image show the commitments I did during the project:

The notebooks I have work on are the ones listed below:

-This notebook was done at the beginning of the project with the help of brian. It was the first time we were cleaning and processing data.[-Load_Files.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/Load_Files.ipynb)

-This notebook reproduce multivariate linear regression for the forecasting of gas usage.[-REGRESSION.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/REGRESSION/REGRESSION.ipynb)

-This notebook reproduce a Deep neural network for the forecasting of gas usage.[-DNN.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/NEURAL/DNN.ipynb)

-This notebook was the first time I tried MVLR. Its not finsihed, but I used different librarys to the other notebooks.
[-Gaspower_Linearregression](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/REGRESSION/gaspower_linearregression.ipynb)

## SCRUM 

Scrum has been used and maintained for 4 sprints of a two week length each, because it was thought to be mandatory. Once we found this wasn't the case, we decided to drop it. This decision has been made because doing sprints the correct SCRUM way did not really apply to our research in a usable and user friendly way. This [link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/PortfolioInf/SCRUM%20ESSAY.docx) takes to the assigned task from the Scrum workshop.
