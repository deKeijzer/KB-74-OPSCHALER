# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

This personal portofolio performs the analysis of the contribution of Víctor Gómez Muñoz, exchange student studying *Applied Data Science* in *The Hague University of Applied Science*, to the project *Opschaler*. 

## DATACAMP COURSES

When I applied to this minor my first priority was learning python. I have worked before with other programing languages such as *Matlab*, *C#* , *R*... Here is a small summary of my progress in *Datacamp*:

## Friday Presentations

In the list below you find all the presentations of *Opshaler* group I took part in. For each of the presentations we chose two different persons so that everyone is involved.

The notebooks I have work on are the ones listed below:

-This notebook was done at the beginning of the project with the help of brian. It was the first time we were cleaning and processing data.[-Load_Files.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/Load_Files.ipynb)

-This notebook reproduce multivariate linear regression for the forecasting of gas usage.[-REGRESSION.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/REGRESSION/REGRESSION.ipynb)

-This notebook reproduce a Deep neural network for the forecasting of gas usage.[-DNN.ipynb](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/VictorC/NEURAL/DNN.ipynb)
