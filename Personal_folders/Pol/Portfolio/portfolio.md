## Short introduction
In this minor, I have been working on the OPSCHALER project. The main goal of the OPSCHALER project is to measure energy consumption in a smarter and a more efficient way. The team consists of multiple interested parties. The Hague University of Applied Sciences is one of them.  
The OPSCHALER team managed to gather data of residential dwellings of smart meter data and additional charastaristics of the specific resident dwelling, such as amount of square feet.  
We were asked to study at the data and come up with a smart way of extracting useful information from the data. We ended it with different machine learning models to evaluate the accuracy of predicting the natural gas consumption of the residents.

## Online courses
### Datacamp
Personally, I had no knowledge about programming whatsoever before starting this minor. In the first eight weeks, the main goal for myself was learning to program in order to do some data cleaning and EDA on the given data. I completed the following datacamp courses in order to crank up my programming skills. Apart from the mandatory courses, I did an additional Bokeh course, just for fun.  
All the Datacamp images are clickable for the respectable state of accomplishments.

### Coursera   
The mandatory coursera courses have been completed. I must admit I had some difficulty understanding everything perfectly at the end (week 6), that's why my last quiz did not go too well (three times). I wish I aced that quiz as well.  
The programming assignments have not been completed.

## Notebooks
During the minor, I always tried to stay up with the insane knowledge of Brian. Obviously, I never quite reached his level (not even close), but I did my best. The following notebooks are generated to try to contribute something to Brian's work.  


[Data preperation](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Pol/Old_files/Data_Prep_Pol.ipynb)  
[The NaN visualiser](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Pol/Old_files/Sensor_data_NaN_vis_if_in_rows.ipynb) is the first actual useful thing I have made for the project. Now it looks extremely easy to me, but at the time I had just started programming and I was actually really proud.  
[MVLR model](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Pol/LR_MVR.ipynb)  
[DNN model](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Pol/DNN.ipynb)  
  
At one point, Victor Garcias and me were working on Bokeh visualisation. Unfortunately, there went something wrong with the server, deleting our shared Bokeh visualisation of our data. I know this is not completely finished now, but this is all that there is left of it:

## Presentations
The friday presentations have been equally shared (as much as possible) between the teammembers. I contributed/did the following presentations:  
[Week 1](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/7-9-2018.pptx) I helped making the presentation.  
[Week 2](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/14-9-2018.pptx) I helped with the making of the presentation.  
[Week 3](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/21-09-2018.pptx) I made and did the presentation with Daan Boesten.  
[Week 7](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/17-10-2018.pptx) Presented by Brian and me.  
[Week 10](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/9-11-2018.pptx) Presented by me, Brian made the presentation.  
  
## Paper contribution
I've put a lot of work into the paper. I started with writing the introduction and the results. The results are also written by Brian. After this I put in over 30 hours of correcting/helping the others.  
  
The full paper can be read [here](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Pol/Portfolio/Images/Opschaler%20paper%20final%20version.pdf).  

## Meeting notes
During this minor, we often had meetings with Baldiri. All the meetings, except one or two where I was feeling ill, have been duely noted and organised. The reason being that we all could look back at our progress and appointments/deadlines we set for ourselves. I tried to maintain a vocal point in the group as far as management/appointments/etc goes. [Here is the list of all the meetings](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/tree/master/Personal_folders/Pol/Portfolio/Images/notes).
