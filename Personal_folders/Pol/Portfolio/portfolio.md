Dwelling: A house where residents live.  


## Short introduction
In this minor, I have been working on the OPSCHALER project. The main goal of the OPSCHALER project is to measure energy consumption in a smarter and a more efficient way. The team consists of multiple interested parties. The Hague University of Applied Sciences is one of them.  
The OPSCHALER team managed to gather data of residential dwellings of smart meter data and additional charastaristics of the specific resident dwelling, such as amount of square feet.  
We were asked to study at the data and come up with a smart way of extracting useful information from the data. We ended it with different machine learning models to evaluate the accuracy of predicting the natural gas consumption of the residents.

## Online courses
### Datacamp
Personally, I had no knowledge about programming whatsoever before starting this minor. In the first eight weeks, the main goal for myself was learning to program in order to do some data cleaning and EDA on the given data. I completed the following datacamp courses in order to crank up my programming skills. Apart from the mandatory courses, I did an additional Bokeh course, just for fun.  
All the Datacamp images are clickable for the respectable state of accomplishments.

### Coursera   
The mandatory coursera courses have been completed. I must admit I had some difficulty understanding everything perfectly at the end (week 6). The programming assignments have not been completed.

## Notebooks
## Presentations
The friday presentations have been equally shared (as much as possible) between the teammembers. I contributed/did the following presentations:  
[Week 1](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/7-9-2018.pptx) I helped making the presentation.  
[Week 2](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/14-9-2018.pptx) I helped with the making of the presentation.
[Week 3](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/21-09-2018.pptx) I made and did the presentation with Daan Boesten.  
[Week 7](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/17-10-2018.pptx) Presented by Brian and me.  
[Week 10](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/appendix/friday%20presentations/9-11-2018.pptx) Presented by me, Briand made the presentation. 

## Meeting notes
During this minor, we often had meetings with Baldiri. All the meetings, except one or two where I was feeling ill, have been duely noted and organised. The reason being that we all could look back at our progress and appointments/deadlines we set for ourselves. Here is the list of all the meetings:
