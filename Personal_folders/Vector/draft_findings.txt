CNN
---------------
Advantages:
- Currently it is one of the most developed technology in the state of art of Machine Learning
- Mostly useful for identifying patterns 
- Other models could be adopted and trained in our data



Disadvantages:
- Data preprocessing and transformation to image
- Results not as good as expected, MAPE of 51% achieved.
- Training time high compared to previous methods, the accuracy/time required ratio is low
- Time series information not considered in the process, to address this problem the next model that includes CNN + RNN + DNN is used



Mixed CNN and RNN
-------------------
Advantages:
- Main advantage 



Disadvantages:
