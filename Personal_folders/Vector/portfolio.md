Assessment of your personal portfolio

The personal portfolio's are assessed individually. The contents of your personal portfolio should reflect your contribution to the project, your abilities and what you have learned. Your portfolio should consist of materials that you either realized individually, or in case of a group effort, a clear statement of what your contribution is in this group effort.

It is important to write your (digital) portfolio in a very easily accessible way. The main document should be like a reader's guide that shortly introduces your contributions and links to pages where the contributions are described in detail. Every contribution should be accessible from the reader's guide in a single click. We are not going to browse the folder, so if you do not link to a document from the reader's guide, we will not include it in the assessment.

For us, it is perfectly acceptable if you write down your portfolio in Github using Markdown, no need to do fancy markups.

Additional portfolio requirements:

    Include your Friday presentations
    Add screenshots of the online courses you have finished (DataCamp, Coursera, etc)
    Link to the Python Notebooks you have finished (you can dump them to PDF)
    List the tickets from the Scrum backlog that you worked on, linked to deliverables, own experiments, etc.
    Add any other assignment you feel is evidence of your abilities

Deadline

Submit your portfolio by the end of week 17.


Feedback moments

We will organize a few feedback moments before the final assessment to make you aware of how your portfolio may be improved. We will announce these feedback moments. Meanwhile, we recommend to keep your portfolio up to date, to fully benefit form the opportunity to receive feedback.



# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

This document gathers the most important steps taken during the Data Analisys course performed by the student Víctor García Romillo. With this document I pretend to reflect the knowledge acquired during the minor and the contributions I made to the Opschaler project.

## DATACAMP COURSES

I finished the mandatory courses that the minor assigns and I also took part in a Bokeh visualization course that helped me to develop one of my finished python notebooks.

## Coursera: Machine Learning by Stanford University
This is my progress in the mandatory coursera program, I still have to work on it

## Python Notebooks 

These are the Python Notebooks I finished containing the code I wrote for the Opschaler project:

-Bokeh visualization (https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/Bokeh_graphs.ipynb)
As we are working with a large dataset we needed a way to visualize and interact with a huge amount of data. This notebook is meant to represent information from the whole dataset, before and after processing it. It was helpful to identify NaN gaps so that the processing of data could fix this problem

-Gas biggest gap (https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/gas_biggest_gap.ipynb)
After doing a visual inspection of data we identified a big number of gaps we had to deal with. Some of the gaps could be interpolated but some others were to big to do so. This notebook removes gap sizes bigger than a certain amount and also returns some important information abount the size of the file until the first big gap is found. This information is relevant to extract some periodicity patterns used later
