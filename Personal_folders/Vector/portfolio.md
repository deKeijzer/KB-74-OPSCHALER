# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

This document gathers the most important steps taken during the Applied Data Science course performed by the student Víctor García Romillo (18076033). With this document I pretend to reflect the knowledge acquired during the minor and the contributions I made to the Opschaler project.

## Datacamp courses

![Summary](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/Resources_portfolio/GeneralDatacam.png)

I finished the mandatory courses that the minor assigns and I also took part in a Bokeh visualization course that helped me to develop one of my finished python notebooks.

## Coursera: Machine Learning by Stanford University
I have completed all mandatory Coursera courses. Green ticks are quizes taken. Programming assingments are not done. Sorry for language missmatch (Semana = Week, Cuestionario = Quiz, Preguntas = Questions).

## Python Notebooks 

These are the Python Notebooks I finished containing the code I wrote for the Opschaler project:

- Bokeh visualization [Github link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/Bokeh_graphs.ipynb)  
As we are working with a large dataset we needed a way to visualize and interact with a huge amount of data. This notebook is meant to represent information from the whole dataset, before and after processing it. It was helpful to identify NaN gaps so that the processing of data could fix this problem

- Gas biggest gap [Github link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/gas_biggest_gap.ipynb)  
After doing a visual inspection of data we identified a big number of gaps we had to deal with. Some of the gaps could be interpolated but some others were to big to do so. This notebook removes gap sizes bigger than a certain amount and also returns some important information abount the size of the file until the first big gap is found. This information is relevant to extract some periodicity patterns used later

- Multivariate Linear Regression [Github link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/MVR.ipynb)  
This notebook was already created by Brian de Keijzer but started over in order to put in practice the knowledge I acquired in this area during the minor.

- Feed forward DNN [Github link](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/DNN.ipynb)  
This notebook was already created by Brian de Keijzer but started over in order to put in practice the knowledge I acquired in this area during the minor.

## SCRUM

Scrum has been used and maintained for 4 sprints of a two week length each, because it was thought to be mandatory.
Once we found this wasn't the case, we decided to drop it.
This decision has been made because doing sprints the correct SCRUM way did not really apply to our research in a usable and user friendly way.
The assigned task from the Scrum workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Personal_folders/Vector/Resources_portfolio/How%20does%20SCRUM%20comply%20Agile%20manifesto%20values.pdf) 

## Paper

In order to finish this portfolio I will state my contributions to the [paper](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/blob/master/Opschaler%20paper%20-%2011-01-2019.pdf).

This paper was a common effort from all the members of the group. We all tried to improve each part, but in order to set some tasks at the beginning of the writing we agreed to divide the work in different parts. I contributed in the metholodogy part with Brian de Keijzer.

I also did some research tasks to find useful papers related with the project. They can be found [here](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER/tree/master/Personal_folders/Vector/Resources_portfolio/20%20articles) 
__(I don't own any of them, please note that credits go to the researchers of each paper)__
