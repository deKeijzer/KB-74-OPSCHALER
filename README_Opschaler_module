read_('select', sample_rate='hour', processed=True)
    Reads in the df, given the Dwelling id. It returns the df + the path of the df.
        select: dwelling_id
        sample_rate: hour/10s
        processed: False. If False is passed, the df of the raw data is given.
          
reduce_memory(df)
    Returns a df where float64's are changed to float32's, which saves a lot of memory
        df: input df that you want to reduce the memory footprint from

dwel_path_id('sample_rate', 'folder', 'combined')
    Returns a list with the filepaths of the files + a list of the dwelling id's.
    If combined is called upon (yes), only the combined df's path is given.
    To store variables:     file_paths, dwelling_ids = op.dwel_path_id('sample_rate', 'folder', 'combined')
        sample_rate: 10s/hour
        folder: processed/unprocessed
        combined: no/yes
        
clean_datetime(df)
    Returns the df where the DateTime has been "cleaned" (set as a datetime object)
        df = Any given dataframe
        
clean_prepared_smart_gas(file_path)
    Returns a prepared df for smart and gas (seperated).
        file_path: a file path to the desired RAW csv file (smartmeter data). 
        
resample_smart_gas(smart, gas)
    Returns smart_resampled and gas_resampled df's
        smart: the dataframe containing clean smart (electricity) data, output from clean_prepared_smart_gas
        gas: the dataframe containing clean gas data, output from clean_prepared_smart_gas
        
merge_smart_gas_weather(smart_resampled, gas_resampled, weather)
        Returns a correct merged df of the three inputs.
            smart_resampled: output of resample_smart_gas
            gas_resampled: output of resample_smart_gas
            weather: the KNMI 10m df. This df should be assigned to the variable weather before using this function.
            
save_df(df, dwelling_id)
    Saves the resampled+merged df in the combined gas/smart/weather folder
        df : output merge_smart_gas_weather
        dwelling_id: the dwelling id used in making the merged df
        


corr_df('len_measurement', 'dwelling_id')
    Returns a heatmap of the processed data, given the resample correlation you want and the dwelling
        len_measurement: 3h/6h/12h/1d/1w
        dwelling_id: any dwelling id. List of dwelling id's in processed can be accessed with file_paths, dwelling_ids = op.dwel_path_id('hour', 'processed', 'no') --> file_paths, dwelling_ids = op.dwel_path_id('sample_rate', 'folder', 'combined')

dwel_len(dwelling_id)
    Returns the length of measurement of the dwelling
