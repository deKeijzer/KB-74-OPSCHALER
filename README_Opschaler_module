read_('select', sample_rate='hour', processed=True)
    Reads in the df, given the Dwelling id.
        select: dwelling_id
        sample_rate: hour/10s
        processed: False. If False is passed, the df of the raw data is given.
    Returns: df, select, complete_path, sample_rate, processed
        

        
    

dwel_path_id('sample_rate', 'folder', 'combined')
    Returns a list with the filepaths of the files + a list of the dwelling id's.
    If combined is called upon (yes), only the combined df's path is given.
    To store variables:     file_paths, dwelling_ids = op.dwel_path_id('sample_rate', 'folder', 'combined')
        sample_rate: 10s/hour
        folder: processed/unprocessed
        combined: no/yes

corr_df('len_measurement', 'dwelling_id')
    Returns a heatmap of the processed data, given the resample correlation you want and the dwelling
        len_measurement: 3h/6h/12h/1d/1w
        dwelling_id: any dwelling id. List of dwelling id's in processed can be accessed with file_paths, dwelling_ids = op.dwel_path_id('hour', 'processed', 'no') --> file_paths, dwelling_ids = op.dwel_path_id('sample_rate', 'folder', 'combined')

dwel_len(dwelling_id)
    Returns the length of measurement of the dwelling
